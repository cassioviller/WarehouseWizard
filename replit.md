# Warehouse Management System (Almoxarifado)

## Overview

This is a full-stack warehouse management system built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. The application provides comprehensive inventory management capabilities including material tracking, stock entry/exit operations, user authentication, and reporting features. The system is designed with multi-tenant architecture supporting role-based access control.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy and session-based auth
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions using connect-pg-simple
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper error handling

### Database Design
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with flexible SSL auto-detection
- **Connection**: Pool-based with automatic SSL detection via URL analysis
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Multi-tenancy**: Owner-based data isolation using `owner_id` field
- **Core Entities**: Users, Categories, Suppliers, Employees, Materials, Stock Entries/Exits

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Session-based authentication with secure password hashing (scrypt)
- Role-based access control (user, admin, super_admin)
- Protected routes with automatic redirection
- Multi-tenant user isolation

### Inventory Management
- **Materials**: Core inventory items with category classification
- **Stock Tracking**: Real-time stock levels with minimum stock alerts
- **Entry/Exit Operations**: Comprehensive tracking of material movements
- **Categories**: Hierarchical organization of materials
- **Suppliers & Employees**: Entity management for tracking relationships

### User Interface
- **Dashboard**: Real-time metrics and stock alerts
- **Material Entry**: Form-based stock entry with supplier tracking
- **Material Exit**: Stock withdrawal with employee assignment
- **Registration System**: Multi-entity CRUD operations (materials, categories, etc.)
- **Reports**: Financial and operational reporting
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with dark mode support

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**: User credentials → Passport.js → Session creation → User context
2. **Inventory Operations**: Form submission → Validation → Database transaction → Cache invalidation → UI update
3. **Real-time Updates**: Database changes → TanStack Query cache invalidation → Automatic UI refresh
4. **Multi-tenant Data**: All operations filtered by user's `ownerId` for data isolation

- **Port Configuration**: Frontend (5000), Backend integrated

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite production build with asset optimization
- **Backend**: esbuild bundling for Node.js deployment
- **Static Assets**: Served from dist/public directory
- **Database**: External PostgreSQL (postgres://estruturas:1234@viajey_cassio:5432/almoxarifado)

### Docker Configuration
- **Base Image**: Node.js 20 slim
- **Port**: 5013 (configurable via PORT env var)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with automatic migration on startup
- **Health Check**: Available at /health endpoint
- **Environment**: Production-ready with proper database connection handling

### Deployment
- **Platform**: EasyPanel with Docker containerization
- **Database**: Native PostgreSQL service in EasyPanel
- **Build Process**: docker build → docker run
- **Auto-migration**: Schema pushed automatically on container startup
- **Connection**: Local TCP connection (no SSL required)
